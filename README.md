![Coop](https://github.com/fallais/go-leboncoin/blob/master/gopher.png)

**go-leboncoin** is a Golang client for the **Le Bon Coin REST API**.

**DISCLAIMER** : This is currently in **beta**, I mean the development is in progress. It is not yet released.

## Aim

The aim is to create a bot that informs you of new ads with the given URL. For example :

```yaml
filters:
  - name: moto
    is_enabled: true
    url: https://www.leboncoin.fr/recherche/?category=3&locations=d_31&moto_type=moto&price=1000-2500&cubic_capacity=500-600
```
